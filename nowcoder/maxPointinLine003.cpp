//like map and vector,this is simple use find for recycle to do it.it is very simple .
//i like suanfa,and i am willing to deal some diffcult question.line is simple. i must write by myself.
//i don not consider of it.i always write my suanfa is ok.this keyboard is so comfortable, i like this keyboard, i use it to write some code, i think is very comfortable.
